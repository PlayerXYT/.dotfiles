# Dotfiles

Just the dotfiles I like to use with bash, neovim, and i3 when I use it. Feel free to copy, or use this as a resource to not have to read the documentation!

**Note:** Not all dotfiles may be fully functional or up to date, you may notice many "echo WIP" commands in my neovim init.lua, this is because I don't know lua very well!
